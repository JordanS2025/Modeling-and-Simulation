How would you visualize changes in data integrity of a digital storage system?
Propose an approach to visualization that can be implemented in a computer
program with the appropriate graphics packages. In your approach, be mindful
that the visualization must be based on quantitative data that represents
various metrics of data integrity in the storage medium. Provide diagrams
and screenshots to support your proposal.

I would visualize changes in data integrity of a digital storage system by
using a ling graph. The x-axis would represent time, and the y-axis would
represent the data integrity of the storage system. The line graph would
hava a line for each metric of data integrity that I want to visualize. For
example, the graph could be updated in real time as the data integrity
of the storage system chages. It would also be color-coded to make it easy
to distinguish between the different metrics of data integrity.
