Based on your initial understanding of ODE, identify two topics related 
to the design and functioning of computer system, for which ODEs are relevant 
and beneficial. Describe the use of ODE in this context and provide concrete 
examples.

Ordinary differential equestions are used in computer science in computer
graphics, machine learning, and probability, to name a few. ODE's may be used
in computer graphics to generate smooth animations and rendering the motion of
objects. ODE's are also utilized in machine learning algorithms through optimization such as gradient descent, which assists in finding a local minimum of a set.

bonus: i just figured out that problems written in sigma notation are simple for-
loops.
