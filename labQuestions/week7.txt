Choose a digital storage medium and identify factors that affect the
degredation of stored data over time.

In this example, we will use a USB flash drive as the digital storage medium. 
The factors that affect the degredation of stored data over time include 
temperature, humidity, light, magnetic fields, physical damage, and time.
All of these factors can cause the flash drive to corrode and the
data to become unreadable.

Explain how you would approach developing a system of ODEs that could model
the degredation process. Present a simple example of such a system.

To develop a system of ODEs that could model the degredation process, we would
need to consider the effects of each factor on the flash drive and the stored
data. For example, we could develop a system of ODEs that models the
corrosion of the flash drive due to temperature, humidity, and time. The
system could include equations that describe the rate of corrosion as a
function of these factors, and how the corrosion affects the readability
of the stored data.

For example, the system of ODEs could include the following equations:
dC/dt = k1 * T * H
where C is the corrosion of the flash drive, T is the temperature, H is the
humidity, and k1 is a constant that represents the rate of corrosion due to
temperature and humidity.

dD/dt = k2 * C * t
where D is the readability of the stored data, t is time, and k2 is a constant
that represents the rate of degradation of the stored data due to corrosion.

These equations could be used to model the degredation process of the flash
drive and the stored data over time.
