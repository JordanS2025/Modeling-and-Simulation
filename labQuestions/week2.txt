How would you write a computer program to solve an ODE? Outline the main
steps and provide a code skeleton for the program. (i.e. variables and
classes & methods stubs - no implementation).

to begin with, we need to define the ODE we want to solve. Once we have
the ODE, we need to define the initial conditions. These conditions may
be given by the ODE itself, or by input from the user. Once we have the
ODE and the initial conditions, we can utilize the scipy library to solve
the ODE. The scipy library has a function called odeint which takes in
the ODE, the initial conditions, and the time steps. The function returns
the solution to the ODE. We can then plot the solution to the ODE. By using
python, we can easily plot the solution to the ODE using the matplotlib
which plots using html.

import scipy
import matplotlib

def solve(initial conditions):
  list ODE function
  return result

solve ode using odeint function as odeint(ODE, initial conditions, time steps)

plot solution using matplotlib
plt.plot(time steps, solution)
